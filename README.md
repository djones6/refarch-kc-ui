# IBM Garage Event-Driven Reference Architecture

## Reefer Container Shipment User Interface

This project is a component of the [Reefer Container Shipment reference implementation](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc/) of the [IBM Garage Event-Driven Architecture](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-eda/) reference architecture. The User Interface  microservice - implemented with Angular and NodeJS - is responsible for managing the user interaction with container shipment capabilities, as well as controlling different simulation capabilities across the reference implementation.

For complete documentation on this project and its peer microservices, reference the **[User Interface](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc/microservices/user-interface/)** microservice page in the [Reefer Container Shipment reference implementation](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc/) gitbook.

## Build & Run

This project is being updated to use the [Appsody](https://appsody.dev/) development framework. For a full understanding of Appsody applications, reference the Appsody [documentation](https://appsody.dev/docs) and [getting started](https://appsody.dev/docs/getting-started/) material respectively.

Specific deployment parameters will be exposed in the `app-deploy.yaml` file for the [User Interface](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-kc-ui/blob/master/app-deploy.yaml) microservice.

For complete documentation on the necessary deployment configuration and parameters, reference the **[User Interface](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc/microservices/user-interface/)** microservice page in the [Reefer Container Shipment reference implementation](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc/) gitbook.
